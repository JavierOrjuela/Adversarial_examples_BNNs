## Adversarial image detection based on Bayesian Neural Layers
This repository contains the scripts used for the paper:  Adversarial image detection based on Bayesian Neural Layers. 
## Abstract
In this work, we analyze the performance of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) endowed with
flexible approximate posterior distribution for detecting adversarial examples.
Furthermore, we study how robust the detection method is when Bayesian layers are located at the top or throughout the DNNs to determine the role of the networkâ€™s hidden layers, and we compare the results with the deterministic ones. We show how BNNs offer a powerful, and practical method of detecting adver-
sarial examples in comparison with deterministic approaches. Finally, we discuss the impact of having well-calibrated models as detectors and how non-gaussian priors enhance the performance of the detection.
